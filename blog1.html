    <h2>IIIT HYDERABAD UG1 - NIFT EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <p><br> We IIITians are preparing for the Felicity FlashMob which is held on 3rd Februrary 2024 at
        Lulu Mall. We all are very much excited to dance there and market our collge to the people.
        It went too great and we got a lot of attention from the people.
        Later, we had dinner there and everyone decided to go NIFT as few days back, NIFT had their flashmob
        in our college. So, we decided to go there and have fun. We went there and at the entry we faced problem
        as the security didn't allow us to enter. But, we managed to enter and we thought of having lot of fun there.
        But everything doesn't goes as we think.
        <br>
        Their show started at 9:00 PM. Firstly, fashion show started and it was trauma for us as we couldn't relate
        to it. Later, oue seniors performed and it was too good. We enjoyed a lot and we had a lot of fun there.
        <br>
        After randomly, we are dancing for the concert songs and whole NIFT is watching us. It felt like only we people
        are
        enjoying more than NIFT students. We chanted "FELICITY FELICITY FELICITY" and we had a lot of fun there.
        It was a great night there.

        <br><br>DOST KO LADKI NHI MILI, SOOO SAD !!
